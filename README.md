# Modgen - Automatic Model Generator
## Overview of Modgen
This program was created for rapid feature engineering without the need to optimize each model.  Modgen is designed to develop a quick overview of how your updated features will react to each model.  You can use one specific algorithm or a wide variety (depending on your interests) with a random feature range which can be easily changed at anytime by the user.
